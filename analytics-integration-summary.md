## Data Collected

### User Information

- Fallback to browser geolocation if needed

### Product Information
- Product ID
- Selected size
- Recommended sizes (primary, smaller, larger)
- Cart integration details

### Session Context
- Session ID for tracking user journey
- Step completion status
- Measurement guide usage

## Error Handling

All analytics calls include proper error handling:
- Non-blocking: Analytics failures don't affect user experience
- Console warnings for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks for network issues

## Performance Considerations

- Location detection is cached after first request
- Analytics calls are asynchronous and non-blocking
- Duplicate event prevention to avoid spam
- Timeout handling for network requests

## No Feature Impact

✅ **All existing features remain unchanged**
✅ **No UI modifications**
✅ **No performance degradation**
✅ **Backward compatible**

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test all user flows** to ensure analytics are firing correctly
2. **Check console logs** for analytics tracking messages
3. **Verify location detection** works in different regions
4. **Test mobile vs desktop** tracking differences
5. **Monitor network requests** to analytics endpoint

## Analytics Endpoint

All events are sent to: `https://data.yoursizer.com/api/log-analytics`

## Next Steps

1. Monitor analytics data collection
2. Verify all events are being tracked correctly
3. Set up dashboards for user behavior analysis
4. Consider adding more granular tracking if needed
