LOGS ANALYSIS SUMMARY

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. DUPLICATE REQUESTS
   - Two identical popup_opened events logged at 10:55:22 with timestamps 465Z and 466Z
   - Same session_id, license_key, and request data
   - This indicates potential double-firing of events or retry mechanism issues

2. MOBILE DETECTION INCONSISTENCY
   - User-Agent shows Android mobile device: "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 6.0; Nexus 5 Build/MRA58N)"
   - All requests have "is_mobile": false in payload
   - sec-ch-ua-mobile header is '?1' indicating mobile
   - Mobile detection logic appears to be malfunctioning

3. TIMING ANOMALIES
   - All step_completed events show "time_spent_ms": 0
   - This suggests timing tracking is not working properly
   - Steps completed instantly without realistic time measurement

4. USER AGENT INCONSISTENCY
   - User-Agent indicates Android 6.0 (very old version from 2015)
   - Chrome version 138.0.0.0 (current version)
   - This combination is impossible - likely spoofed or emulated

5. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT EXPOSURE
   - Origin: http://localhost:5173 (development server)
   - Referer: http://localhost:5173/
   - Production system receiving requests from localhost indicates misconfiguration

6. SIZE RECOMMENDATION LOGIC ISSUE
   - User selected size: "L"
   - System recommended: "XL" as primary, "L" as smaller
   - This suggests the algorithm may not be working as expected

7. SESSION MANAGEMENT
   - Single session_id used throughout: "0ba9e009-c949-4832-b468-7103492511fc"
   - All events properly maintain session continuity
   - No session management issues detected

8. LOCATION DATA CONSISTENCY
   - All requests show same location: India, Hyderabad, Telangana
   - IP address: 49.205.240.50
   - Location data appears consistent and realistic

9. LICENSE KEY USAGE
   - Single license key used: "fc43e243-4f85-41ac-9ead-4d935707a8da"
   - No license validation errors detected
   - License appears to be working correctly

10. EVENT FLOW ANALYSIS
    - Proper sequence: popup_opened → gender_selected → step_completed (gender) → step_completed (basic) → step_completed (detailed) → size_recommended
    - Event flow is logical and complete
    - No missing or out-of-order events

CRITICAL ISSUES:
- Duplicate event logging needs immediate attention
- Mobile detection failure could impact analytics accuracy
- Zero time tracking indicates broken timing mechanism
- Development environment exposure is a security concern

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement duplicate request detection and prevention
2. Fix mobile detection logic to properly parse User-Agent
3. Debug and fix timing measurement functionality
4. Ensure production environment doesn't accept localhost requests
5. Review size recommendation algorithm logic
6. Investigate User-Agent spoofing/emulation
